# Motion Planning Algorithm using DRL and Waymax Simulator

## Project Overview

Welcome to the 5ARIP10 Interdisciplinary Team Project, Track 2, Group 1. Our project focuses on developing and evaluating a motion planning algorithm using the Waymax simulator. We extract scenarios from the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) to create a comprehensive testing environment for our algorithm.

## Approach

Our approach integrates a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based method to create and optimize safe and efficient vehicle trajectories in multi-actor scenarios. By leveraging the extensive data from WOMD and the capabilities of the Waymax simulator, we aim to advance the state-of-the-art in motion planning for autonomous vehicles.

## Key Features

- **RL Repository**: Our RL algorithms can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/Besttenson/5ARIP10/tree/main/RL). This includes the implementation and training details for creating RL models.
- **Scenario Extraction**: We utilize scenarios extracted from the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) to test and evaluate our motion planning algorithm, ensuring it performs well in diverse and realistic situations. The method to realize that can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/Besttenson/5ARIP10/tree/main/waymo_motion_scenario_mining).
